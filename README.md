# 🍃 leaf-interaction

A simple Unity project that simulates physics and interaction with a floating leaf, including gravity, air resistance, sway, drag/throw, bounce, and squash/stretch. All without using Unity’s built in physics (no Rigidbody2D or colliders).

## 🛠️ Features
- Custom gravity & terminal velocity
- Air resistance with X/Y drag
- Swaying and flutter animation (wind-like movement)
- Mouse drag-and-throw interaction
- Bounce with squash/stretch on impact
- Entirely physics-free (no Rigidbody2D or colliders)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open the project in Unity (preferably **2022 LTS or later**).
3. Open the scene named **`LeafScene`**.
4. Press **Play** to test the interaction.
5. You can adjust several different variables from the inspector, in the Leaf object.

## 🖱️ Controls

- **Click & drag** the leaf to move it.
- **Release** the mouse to throw it with a floaty, physics-like motion.
